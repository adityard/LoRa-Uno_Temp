# ArduinoLoRa
This project demonstrates the basic usage of LoRa RA-02 Module. 

Make sure that you check the frequency band as it varies from country to country. 

I have used the arduino-LoRa library by Sandeep Mistry ( https://github.com/sandeepmistry/arduino-LoRa ).
I'm using LoRa RA-02 to transmit temperature values read by a temperature sensor every 5 seconds from Arduino UNO to another Arduino UNO and display on the Serial Monitor.
