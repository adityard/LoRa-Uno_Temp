# ArduinoLoRa
Simple demonstration of usage of LoRa RA-02 Module to transmit temperature sensor values using Arduino UNO.
This project demonstrates the basic usage of LoRa RA-02 Module. 
Make sure that you check the frequency band as it varies from country to country. 
I have used the arduino-LoRa library by Sandeep Mistry ( https://github.com/sandeepmistry/arduino-LoRa ).
I'm using LoRa RA-02 to transmit temperature values read by a temperature sensor from Arduino UNO to another Arduino UNO and display on the Serial Monitor.
